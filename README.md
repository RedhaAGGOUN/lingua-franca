# 🌍 Lingua Franca

**Lingua Franca** is a multilingual translation web app built with Python and Flask. It allows users to translate content instantly — whether typed, spoken, or extracted from a PDF — and listen to the translation out loud. The name reflects our desire to bridge cultures, one sentence at a time.

## 📚 Context: A Journey Through the Art of Translation

From ancient trade in Mesopotamia to AI-powered language models, translation has always shaped the way humans communicate and share knowledge. Today, the challenge is not only to understand different languages, but to do so quickly and intuitively.

This project was developed as part of a pedagogical exercise at *La Plateforme_*, applying core backend concepts (Flask, API calls) and frontend integration (HTML, JS, CSS). But it also aimed to embrace the modern experience of translation: live, real-time, and multimodal.
